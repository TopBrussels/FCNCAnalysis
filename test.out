Data set other has 9898 events with positive weights and 102 events with negative weights.
         Pos - neg is 9796, pos + neg is 10000
The sum of the weights is 9796, whereas the total number of events is 10000
This corresponds to an event scale factor of 0.9796
n events passed_Step2  =  9994
n events passed_Step3  =  9905
n events passed_Step4  =  888
n events passed_Step5  =  722
